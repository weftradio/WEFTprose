## Check for remote to local git sync

Let's see if this shit works the way I expect it to work.  Where the way I expect includes:

1. publish to the online gh-pages branch of the repo
2. enable pubication by turning it to true
3. then press the sync button in GH 4 Mac to see if it acts like running `git pull`.
