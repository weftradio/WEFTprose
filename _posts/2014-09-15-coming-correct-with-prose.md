## Coming Correct with Prose!

Ok motherfucker, shit should be working correctly right now!

Big shot out to [the Jekyll docs re: gh-pages](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/github-pages/).

The latest update included the following advances:
  - proper usage of `baseurl` in `_config.yml`
  - proper usage locally in serving jekyll by passing the empty stringed `baseurl` flag
  - proper usage of `{{ site.baseurl }}{{ post.url }}` when linking to blog posts from source file.

__OK LET's GO!__
